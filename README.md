# Exploratory Data Analysis with R
## Roger D. Peng

This repository contains the files for the book *Exploratory Data Analysis with R*, as it is built on [bookdown.org]() and on
[Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/exdata/). This book was originally
published on Leanpub (and still is). The two versions are identical.

Currently, there are three branches:

* `master`: contains the main book source Rmd files

* `leanpub`: contains Leanpub-specific stuff

* `bookdown`: used to build the Bookdown version of the book
